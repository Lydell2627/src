Welcome to the **src** repository! This project is a robust Node.js application that utilizes an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture with well-structured controllers, models, routes, and middlewares. Whether you're a contributor or a curious onlooker, this README will give you a comprehensive look at what’s inside, how we built it, and the evolution of the codebase.

## Project Overview

**src** is designed as a scalable web application built on Node.js and Express. Its modular design allows for easy expansion and maintenance. The project serves as a template for creating applications that need clear separation of concerns and well-organized code.

## Features

- **MVC Architecture**: Separation of concerns with dedicated folders for controllers, models, routes, and middlewares.
- **Database Integration**: Ready to connect with your preferred database (configurable via `db/`).
- **Utility Functions**: Handy utilities in the `utils/` folder to speed up development.
- **Express Server**: A fully functional Express server configured in `app.js`.
- **Environment Configurations**: Easy configuration management through environment variables.
